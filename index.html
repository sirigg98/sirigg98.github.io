    <p>Hello Welcome! My name is Sirig and I am from Kathmandu, Nepal. 
        I currently work as a predoctoral research fellow at Stanford Institute 
        for Economic Policy and Research (SIEPR) under <a href = "http://stanford.edu/~memorten/Melanie_Morten.html">Melanie Morten</a> and <a href = "https://jweinstein.sites.stanford.edu/">Jeremy Weinstein</a>. 
        My primary interests lie in Development, Migration and Network Theory.</p>
    <p>Previously, I was lucky to work as a research assistant to <a href = "https://sites.google.com/site/davinchor/?pli=1">Davin Chor</a> at the Tuck School of Business, conducting research on Trade and the Political Economy. I graduated from Amherst College in 2021 with a B.A. in Economics and Mathematics. 
        Here is <a href = "pdf files/SirigGurung_CV.pdf">my CV</a> (last updated Jan 2023).</p> 
        
    <p>You can reach me at sirigg (at) stanford (dot) edu.</p>
