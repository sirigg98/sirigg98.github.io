                <p class = "desc"> Has large-scale censorship in China affected the diffusion of knowledge in economics?  <br> 
                    We study changes in citations for papers by faculty who host research on google sites, which was banned in China in 2010 with the introduction of the Great Firewall (GFC). 
                    Data was collected by scraping Google Scholar and faculty personal websites. 
                    Our findings show that papers written by authors whose personal websites are hosted on Google Sites had 4.2 fewer citations between 2011 and 2020, and that this effect is entirely driven by papers written by younger authorship teams.

            <li><strong>"It Takes a Village: Reshaping the Perception of Community Gender Norms in India" (Ph.D. Application Writing Sample)</strong><br>
                <p class = "desc"> What are the locality-level spillovers of reshaping deeply entrenched gender norms among young adolescents? <br> 
                    This paper studies the spillovers of an school-based intervention that aimed to reshape gender norms in the state of Haryana, India. 
                    I use an estimator developed in Borusyak and Hull (2023) and data from Dhar, Jain, and Jayachandran (2022) to identify unbiased estimates of spillovers at the locality level. 
                    I find strong effects of having more program participants in a locality on students' perceptions of community norms on women and access to education in the short-run. 
                    I also highlight a drawback of this novel estimator: even in RCTs with small samples that randomize the treatment by strata, drawing a representative sample of treatment assignments is infeasible, implying that this estimator is impractical for RCTs implemented at-scale.

            <li><strong>"International Spillovers of Surprise Monetary Policy: India's Demonetization and the Nepali Economy" (Undergraduate Thesis)</strong><br>
                <p class = "desc"> Does migration mediate spillovers of domestic policy across borders?  <br> 
                    I investigate this by viewing the India's demonetization policy of 2016 as a natural experiment. 
                    India shares an open border with Nepal, which facilitates large flows of migration to India for employement.
                    I examine whether Night-Time light intensity, a proxy for economic activity, decreased in districts with larger shares of migrants to India. At this level, I only find null results. 
                    However, narrowing in on rural households in Nepal, I find that households with a migrant to India decrease expenditures on infrequently purchased items by 35%.
                    Spending on frequently purchased items is unchanged.
                    I also find that informal borrowing almost doubled post-demonetization, suggesting that these households heavily rely on informal credit systems to manage negative shocks.
